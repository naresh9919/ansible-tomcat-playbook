Ansible Vault is an Ansible feature that helps you encrypt confidential information without compromising security.

Ansible Vault performs various operations. Specifically, it can

1.Encrypt a file
2.Decrypt a file
3.View an encrypted file without breaking the encryption
4.Edit an encrypted file
5.Create an encrypted file
6.Generate or reset the encrypted key

1.Create an encrypted file

file name :- vinay

# ansible-vault create vinay

new vault password: vinay
conform new vault password: vinay

prompt will open---- give some data

save the file and check list

# cat vinay

data will not open because it is encryped


2.Decrypting a file
# ansible-vault decrypt vinay
vault password:
decryption successful

# cat vinay
now data can see

3.View an encrypted file without breaking the encryption

# ansible-vault view vinay
vault password:
we can see the data

4.Editing the encrypted file

# ansible-vault edit vinay
vault password:
we can edit the data

5.Reset the file password

# ansible-vault rekey vinay.yml

vault password: vinay
new vault password: siddu
conform new vault password: siddu
rekey successful

6.Decrypt a running playbook

# ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass vinay.yml

vault password:
now we can run a playbook


if you do not want to enter passwords every time, for that 
we need to create a a file

file name:- pass
# vim pass
 
store passwords here and save

now run the playbook

# ansible-playbook vinay.yml --vault-password-file pass


if pass file is in /opt/ at the time

# ansible-playbook vinay.yml --vault-password-file /opt/pass
